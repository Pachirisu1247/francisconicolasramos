This page will host my science communication tutorials and related articles in the near future. New articles will appear and be hosted here. Please check back later for updates.

You may access my last educational article and R tutorial, **“Introducing Machine Learning Models for Psychologists—Random Forest”**, on Dr. Mark Lai's Measurement and Multilevel Modeling website at [this link](https://mmmlab.rbind.io/posts/2025-03-25-random-forest/). I am currently working on an addendum that reviews feature selection methods for random forest modeling in depth. The addendum will soon be posted to this page.
