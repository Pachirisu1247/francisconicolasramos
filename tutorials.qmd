This page will host my science communication tutorials and related articles in the near future. New articles will appear and be hosted here. Please check back later for updates.

“[Introducing Machine Learning Models for Psychologists—Random Forest](https://mmmlab.rbind.io/posts/2025-03-25-random-forest/)”, my first educational article and R tutorial, can be accessed on Dr. Mark Lai’s **Measurement and Multilevel Modeling Lab** website. I am currently working on an addendum that reviews feature selection methods for random forest modeling in depth. The addendum will soon be posted to this page.
